    <p>
      A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a
      constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary
      educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, an
      institution offering vocational education, a further education
      institution, or a secondary school. In most of the world, a college may be
      a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, a
      training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher-education
      provider that does not have university status (often without its own
      degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. In the
      United States, a college may offer undergraduate programs – either as an
      independent institution or as the undergraduate program of a university –
      or it may be a residential college of a university or a community college,
      referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions that aim to
      provide affordable and accessible education, usually limited to two-year
      associate degrees.[1] The word is generally also used as a synonym for a
      university in the US.[2] Colleges in countries such as France, Belgium,
      and Switzerland provide secondary education.
